 * The Event Observer is a way for the window to notify observers when an event occurs.

/***
 * The Event Observer interface is very simple. Any class that wished to handle an

 * and are assumed to have dealt with it.
 * It would be possible to extend the system so that events of different types could
 * be subscribed to by different classes.
