/**
 *
 * The RobotControl class is responsible for the behavior of the robot in the
 * environment made available by the RobotDisplay class.
 *
 * For a micromouse, this includes path planning, searching, mapping,
 * and other decision-making behaviors. It can be adapted for other types of robots.
 *
 * The RobotControl class holds an instance of the Robot class and a logical
 * representation of the Maze. The physical maze is maintained and updated by
 * the main thread.
 *
 * Synchronization between RobotControl and RobotDisplay is managed using
 * condition variables. RobotControl sets a request flag and calls notify_all().
 * RobotDisplay responds by calculating sensor readings appropriate to the current
 * robot state and updating the Robot instance.
 *
 * Core Features of RobotControl
 * Behavioral Logic:
 *    - Implements decision-making algorithms such as path planning, mapping, and navigation.
 *    - Reacts to sensor data (e.g., front distance, wall proximity) for obstacle avoidance or exploration.
 *
 * Synchronization:
 *    - Uses a std::condition_variable to coordinate updates between threads:
 *    - Notifies the RobotDisplay thread to update sensor data.
 *    - Waits for the updated data to proceed with control logic.
 *
 * Robot Interaction:
 *    - Directly interacts with the Robot instance to access pose, velocity, or other state data.
 *
 * Environment Access:
 *    - Maintains a reference to a Maze object, which represents the logical environment
 *      for pathfinding and navigation.
 *
 * mRobot, mMaze and mSensorData are private members of RobotControl accessed
 * through methods that ensure thread safety. RobotControl manages all synchronization
 * between threads.
