Applying Reynolds' steering behaviors to real-world two-wheeled, non-holonomic robots (such as differential drive
robots) is feasible but requires adjustments to account for physical constraints and limitations. Here’s a breakdown of
the challenges and adaptations needed:

---

### Key Differences Between Simulated Agents and Real Robots

1. **Non-Holonomic Constraints**:
    - Two-wheeled robots can't move sideways directly; they are limited to forward/backward motion and turning.
    - Steering commands must be converted to linear and angular velocities.

2. **Physical Dynamics**:
    - Real robots have inertia, limited acceleration, and deceleration.
    - Motor dynamics, wheel slip, and other physical effects must be considered.

3. **Sensor and Localization Limitations**:
    - Simulated agents have perfect knowledge of their position, velocity, and surroundings.
    - Real robots depend on sensors (e.g., odometry, GPS, LiDAR, cameras) which introduce noise and may have limited
      accuracy.

4. **Actuation and Control**:
    - Real robots require control laws to convert desired motion into wheel velocities (e.g., PID controllers or more
      advanced techniques).

### Adapting Reynolds’ Steering Behaviors

#### 1. **Seek, Flee, and Arrive**

- These behaviors compute a desired velocity vector in the global frame.
- For a non-holonomic robot:
    - Break the desired velocity into **linear** (\(v\)) and **angular** (\(\omega\)) components relative to the robot's
      frame.
    - Compute \(\omega\) based on the angular difference between the robot's current heading and the desired heading.

**Implementation**:
\[
v = \min(\text{desired\_speed}, v_{\text{max}})
\]
\[
\omega = k_p \cdot \text{angle\_error}
\]
Where \(k_p\) is a proportional gain, and \(\text{angle\_error}\) is the difference between the robot's orientation and
the desired heading.

#### 2. **Alignment, Cohesion, and Separation**

- These behaviors are based on the positions and velocities of neighbors.
- Compute a single desired direction for the robot using weighted sums of alignment, cohesion, and separation forces.
- Use the resulting desired velocity as input to the kinematic controller described above.

#### 3. **Path Following and Circling**

- For circling, the robot’s desired trajectory is a circular path around a center point. The robot can use a pure
  pursuit controller to track the path:
    - Select a point on the circle a fixed "lookahead" distance from the robot.
    - Use seek behavior to steer toward this point.
- Ensure smooth transitions by adjusting angular velocity \(\omega\) based on the curvature of the path.

#### 4. **Wander**

- For real robots, generate a smooth, random angular velocity \(\omega\) to change the robot's heading incrementally
  rather than setting arbitrary new headings.

### Real-World Considerations

1. **Control and Stability**:
    - A low-level controller is needed to ensure smooth transitions between velocities and to avoid oscillations or
      instability in turning.

2. **Obstacle Avoidance**:
    - Incorporate real-time sensor data for obstacle detection.
    - Modify separation behavior to prioritize avoiding collisions based on sensor input (e.g., LiDAR or ultrasonic
      sensors).

3. **Noise and Uncertainty**:
    - Use filtering techniques (e.g., Kalman Filter, Particle Filter) to smooth localization and sensor data.

4. **Velocity Limits**:
    - Account for hardware limits on linear and angular velocities. Scale the desired velocity vector appropriately.

5. **Energy Efficiency**:
    - Smooth trajectories minimize energy use. For instance, avoid aggressive oscillations in steering.

### Example Workflow for a Two-Wheeled Robot

1. **Compute Steering Behavior**:
    - Use Reynolds' rules to compute a desired velocity vector \(V_d = (v_x, v_y)\) in the global frame.
2. **Convert to Robot Frame**:
    - Compute the heading error:
      \[
      \text{angle\_error} = \text{atan2}(v_y, v_x) - \text{robot\_heading}
      \]
    - Compute linear and angular velocities:
      \[
      v = \text{magnitude}(V_d)
      \]
      \[
      \omega = k_p \cdot \text{angle\_error}
      \]
3. **Control Actuation**:
    - Use a differential drive model:
      \[
      \text{left\_wheel\_speed} = v - \frac{L \cdot \omega}{2}
      \]
      \[
      \text{right\_wheel\_speed} = v + \frac{L \cdot \omega}{2}
      \]
      Where \(L\) is the distance between the wheels.

4. **Execute and Update**:
    - Send the computed wheel speeds to the robot.
    - Update the robot’s position and velocity based on sensor feedback.

### Summary

Adapting Reynolds’ steering behaviors for two-wheeled, non-holonomic robots is a straightforward yet nuanced process:

- **Conceptual Alignment**: The high-level behaviors remain unchanged (seek, flee, etc.).
- **Kinematic Adaptation**: Use control laws to translate desired velocities into feasible linear and angular motions.
- **Physical Considerations**: Account for real-world dynamics, sensor noise, and hardware limits.
