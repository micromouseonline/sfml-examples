# SFML examples

A series of small SFML example programs to help me learn my way around.

The individual targets mostly illustrate a single feature.

These are likely to change without warning and any or all of them may fail to build or run.

Tha top level CMakeLists.txt file should include any additions. Have a look for how this is done.

Take care that the working directory of the compiled executable can see the assets as a sub-directory.

No idea if this builds in Windows. Let me know. Make a pull request to offer changes for building in windows if needed.

### prerequisites
